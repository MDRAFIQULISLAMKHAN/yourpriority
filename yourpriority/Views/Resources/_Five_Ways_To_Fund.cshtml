                                            Considering transforming your home from ‘banal’ to ‘brilliant’, but lack the
                                            funds to support your makeover? Never fear, we’ve rounded up five home renovation
                                            finance options that could help turn your dream into reality.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            This is probably the most common way people borrow money when they want to renovate.
                                            It involves borrowing against the current value of your home, before any value-adding
                                            renovations and in most cases allows you to obtain the funds upfront. You won’t be
                                            able to borrow the full value of your home but, without mortgage insurance, you can
                                            usually borrow up to 80 per cent of its value if you own it outright. One potential
                                            problem is that the cost of your renovations may actually be higher than the equity
                                            you have available. If you run out of funds mid-construction, and if the property is
                                            then not in sound, lock up condition, you may have an issue obtaining extra funds down
                                            the track.

                                <p><span class="highlight bold-font">2. Construction loan</span></p>

                                <p>
                                    If you're planning to completely transform your home and undergo a major makeover, this may be
                                    a good option as you can spread the cost over a long period of time. You could even possibly
                                    borrow up to 90 per cent of the end value of your home and take advantage of mortgage rates
                                    which tend to be lower than credit card and personal loan rates. With a construction loan,
                                    the lender will assess the value of your home after the renovation based on the building plans
                                    and you can typically borrow against that value. You won’t be given the full loan amount upfront,
                                    but usually in staggered amounts over a period of time – this is called ‘progress payments’ and
                                    is linked to a fixed price building contract which will be from your builder.
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="highlight bold-font">3. Line of credit</span></p>
                                <p>
                                    When you apply, you can establish a revolving credit line that you can access whenever you want to up
                                    to your approved limit. You only pay interest on the funds you use and, as you pay off your balance,
                                    you can re-borrow the unused funds without reapplying if that becomes necessary. &nbsp;However, care
                                    must be taken not to get in over your head in terms of serviceability. Make sure you can make repayments
                                    on the line of credit that will reduce the principle because your minimum repayment only pays the interest,
                                    it will not reduce the loan. Rates on this product are typically much higher than a construction loan or top
                                    up loan. This product feature is great if managed well, but can also be a trap if not seriously considered as
                                    your limit will never change.
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="highlight bold-font">4. Personal loan</span></p>
                                <p>
                                    If you’re only making minor renovations – personal loans are usually capped at around $30,000 – this might be
                                    suitable, but interest rates on personal loans are higher than on home equity loans and payments need to be made
                                    usually over a maximum of seven years.
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="highlight bold-font">5. Credit cards</span></p>
                                <p>
                                    This option should only be considered if you want to undertake really small renovation projects. The interest rates
                                    are usually much higher than on mortgages, but for a very small project, that extra interest might actually total
                                    less than loan establishment fees.
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="highlight bold-font">One thing you must do</span></p>
                                <p>
                                    There are very few exceptions to the rule that your renovations should add more value to your home than they will
                                    cost to carry out. Think about how the money you spend on a renovation will increase the value of your property.
                                    For example, consider making changes that would appeal to the majority of potential buyers to help you sell your
                                    house faster and at a higher price.
                                </p>
