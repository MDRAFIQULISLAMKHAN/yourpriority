                                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>When the law authorises or requires us to collect information</strong></p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">We may collect information about you because we are required or authorised by law to collect it. There are laws which require us to collect personal information. For example, we require personal information to verify your identity under Australian Anti-Money Laundering law.&nbsp;</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>What do we collect via your website activity?</strong></p>

                                <p>If you’re an internet customer of ours, we monitor your use of internet services to ensure we can verify you and can receive information from us, and to identify ways we can improve our services for you.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">If you start but don’t submit an on-line application, we can contact you using any of the contact details you’ve supplied to offer help completing it. The information in applications will be kept temporarily then destroyed if the application is not completed.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">We also know that some customers like to engage with us through social media channels. We may collect information about you when you interact with us through these channels. However, for all confidential matters, we’ll ensure we interact with you via a secure forum.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">To improve our services and products, we sometimes collect de-identified information from web users. That information could include IP addresses or geographical information to ensure your use of our web applications is secure.</p>

                                <h4 style="text-align: justify"><strong>How we collect and hold your information</strong></h4>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">Unless it’s unreasonable or impracticable, we will try to collect personal information directly from you (referred to as ‘<span class="bold-font">solicited information</span>’).&nbsp; For this reason, it’s important that you help us to do this and keep your contact details up-to-date.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">There are a number of ways in which we may seek information from you. We might collect your information when you fill out a form with us, when you’ve given us a call or used our website. We also find using electronic means, such as email or SMS, a convenient way to communicate with you and to verify your details¹.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>How we collect your information from other sources</strong></p>

                                <p>Sometimes, we will collect information about you from other sources as the Privacy Act 1988 permits.&nbsp; We will do this only if it’s reasonably necessary to do so, for example, where:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>we collect information from third parties about the loan or lease made available to you arising out of the services we provide you;</li>
                                    <li>we can’t get hold of you and we rely on public information (for example, from public registers or social media) or made available by third parties) to update your contact details; or</li>
                                    <li>we exchange information with your legal or financial advisers or other representatives.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>What if you don't want to provide us with your personal information?</strong></p>

                                <p>If you don’t provide your information to us, it may not be possible:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>for us to give you the credit assistance you seek from us;</li>
                                    <li>to assist in finding a loan or lease relevant to your circumstances;</li>
                                    <li>verify your identity or protect against fraud; or</li>
                                    <li>to let you know about other products or services that might be suitable for your financial needs.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>How we collect and hold your credit information</strong></p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">We will collect your credit information in the course of you answering the enquiries we make of you relating to the credit assistance you seek from us. In addition to what we say above about collecting information from other sources, other main sources for collecting credit information are:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">your co-loan applicants or co-borrowers;</li>

                                    <li style="text-align: justify">your employer, accountant, real estate agent or other referees;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">your agents and other representatives&nbsp; like the person who referred your business to us, your solicitors, conveyancers and settlement agents;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">organisations that&nbsp; help us to process credit applications;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">organisations that&nbsp; check the security you are offering&nbsp; such as valuers;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">bodies that issue identification documents to help us check your identity; and</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">our service providers involved in helping us to process any application you make for credit through us.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>What do we do when we get information we didn’t ask for?</strong></p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">Sometimes, people share information with us we haven’t sought out (referred to as ‘<span class="bold-font">unsolicited information</span>’). Where we receive unsolicited personal information about you, we will check whether that information is reasonably necessary for our functions or activities. If it is, we’ll handle this information the same way we do with other information we seek from you. If not, we’ll ensure we do the right thing and destroy or de-identify it.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>When will we notify you that we have received your information?</strong></p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">When we receive personal information from you directly, we’ll take reasonable steps to notify you how and why we collected your information, who we may disclose it to and outline how you can access it, seek correction of it or make a complaint.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">Sometimes we collect your personal information from third parties. You may not be aware that we have done so. If we collect information that can be used to identify you, we will take reasonable steps to notify you of that collection.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>How do we take care of your personal information?</strong></p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">We store information in different ways, including in paper and electronic form. The security of your personal information is important to us and we take reasonable steps to protect it from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the ways we do this are:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">document storage security policies;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">security measures for access to our systems; and</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">only giving access to personal information to a person who is verified to be able to receive that information</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">We may store personal information physically or electronically with third party data storage providers. Where we do this, we use contractual arrangements to ensure those providers take appropriate measures to protect that information and restrict the uses to which they can put that information.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>What happens when we no longer need your information?</strong></p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">We’ll only keep your information for as long as we require it for our purposes.&nbsp; We may be required to keep some of your information for certain periods of time under law.&nbsp; When we no longer require your information, we’ll ensure that your information is destroyed or de-identified.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">Collecting your personal information allows us to provide you with the products and services you’ve asked for.&nbsp; This means we can use your information to:</p>

                                <p>We may store your information in cloud or other types of networked or electronic storage.&nbsp; As electronic or networked storage can be accessed from various countries via an internet connection, it’s not always practicable to know in which country your information may be held.

                                <p style="text-align: justify">We‘ll always give you access to your personal information unless there are certain legal reasons why we can’t.

                                <p style="text-align: justify">We will give you access to your information in the form you want it where it’s reasonable and practical. We may charge you a small fee to cover our costs when giving you access, but we’ll always check with you first.</p>

                                    <li style="text-align: justify">there is an unreasonable impact on other individuals;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">the request is frivolous;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">the information wouldn’t be ordinarily accessible because of legal proceedings;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">it would prejudice negotiations with you;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">it would be unlawful;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">it would jeopardise taking action against serious misconduct by you;</li>
                                    <li style="text-align: justify">it would be likely to harm the activities of an enforcement body (e.g. the police); or</li>

                                <p><strong>What additional things do we have to do to manage your complaints about credit information?</strong></p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">If your complaint relates to how we handled your access and correction requests:</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">You may take your complaint directly to our external dispute resolution scheme or the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.&nbsp; You are not required to let us try to fix it first.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">For all other complaints relating to credit information:</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">If you make a complaint about things (other than an access request or correction request) in relation to your credit information, we will let you know how we will deal with it within seven days.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">Ask for more time if we can’t fix things in 30 days:</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">If we can’t fix things within 30 days, we’ll let you know why and how long we think it will take. We will also ask you for an extension of time to fix the matter. If you have any concerns, you may complain to our external dispute resolution scheme or the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">Letting you know about our decision:</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify">We’ll let you know about our decision within 30 days or any longer agreed time frame. If you have any concerns, you may complain to our external dispute resolution scheme or the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</p>
